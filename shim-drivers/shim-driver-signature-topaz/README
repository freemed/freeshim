SHIM driver for Topaz System SigPlus-driver based signature pads.

This driver has been tested with:

	SignatureGem4x5
	SignatureGemLCD1x5

To install properly in udev-based systems, create
"/etc/udev/rules.d/99-topaz.rules" with the following content:

  SUBSYSTEM=="usb", SYSFS{idVendor}=="06a8", MODE="0666"

This should allow all users to read and write data to/from any
Topaz Systems tablet.
