Basics:

SHIM webapp component. This is a J2EE web application with CXF-based
SOAP/REST services. The WSDL is available at

	http://host:port/shim/services/ShimService?wsdl

(with the appropriate values of "host" and "port" used, of course. It
uses an internal job store queueing system which is by default stored in
${catalina.home}/work/jobstore.db but can be overridden by the properties
"overrides" file, which can be specified by defining the "properties"
property like this:

	-Dshim.properties=/path/to/the/config/shim.properties

Building:

1) "mvn package". You'll probably have to run this from the root of the
   shim source so that all dependent libraries are built, etc. The final
   packaged version is available in ${SHIM}/shim-webapp/target/shim.war

Installation:

1) Copy "shim.war" from "target" into webapps directory of Tomcat
   install.

2) Copy native libraries into the appropriate place.

3) Create shim.properties file with any overrides for configuration.
   Anything which isn't overridden has default values which should
   work for most common configurations. *Most*.

4) Start tomcat with:

   JAVA_OPTS="-Dshim.properties=${TOMCAT_HOME}/shim.properties" ./bin/catalina.sh start

--- Installation with Debian packages/integration ---

1) apt-get install tomcat5.5 sun-java6-jre

2) Copy librxtx*.so into /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun/jre/lib/$ARCH/
   (where $ARCH is amd64, i386, etc). You have to use rxtx v2.2pre2,
   otherwise it won't work. Don't ask why, just understand it won't
   work if you don't use the newer version. Don't use the
   librxtx-java package, it's old.

3) Copy shim.war from "target" into
   /var/lib/tomcat5.5/webapps/ and make its owner "tomcat55"

4) Append the following lines to /etc/default/tomcat5.5:

   JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
   JAVA_OPTS=" -Dshim.properties=/etc/shim.properties "
   TOMCAT5_SECURITY=no

5) Add credentials to /var/lib/tomcat5.5/conf/tomcat-users.xml like:

   <role rolename="default" />
   <user username="Administrator" password="password" roles="default" />

6) Create shim.properties file with any overrides.
   (Anything which isn't overridden has default values.)

   Make sure to copy the file to /etc/shim.properties when you
   have finished making your changes.

7) Add the "tomcat55" user to the "lp" and "dialout" groups, and make
   any necessary udev changes for Topaz signature pads, etc.

8) Start tomcat with:

   /etc/init.d/tomcat5.5 restart

9) The URL for this instance will be:

   http://${MACHINE-NAME-OR-IP}:8180/shim/services/ShimService?wsdl
