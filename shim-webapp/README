SHIM webapp component. This is a J2EE web application with CXF-based
SOAP/REST services. The WSDL is available at

	http://host:port/shim/services/ShimService?wsdl

(with the appropriate values of "host" and "port" used, of course. It
uses an internal job store queueing system which is by default stored in
${catalina.home}/work/jobstore.db but can be overridden by the properties
"overrides" file, which can be specified by defining the "properties"
property like this:

	-Dproperties=/path/to/the/config/shim.properties
